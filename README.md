# Trinity-Renderer
This is a [metahook](https://github.com/Nagist/metahook) plugin, we change original [Trinity Renderer](http://www.moddb.com/mods/trinity-render-custom-edition) code, let it can use in Counter-Strike.

Changed detail textures file target from _detail to _detailHD to avoid original game engine and Trinity looking for same file and fail.
